# Intussusception Addon

A functional add-on for generating Intussusception structures in Blender

###Overview

Intussusception is the process by which 1 blood vessel splits into 2, and then into 4 and so on. This add-on is an attempt to model this process in order to create functional positive flow models for 3D vascular networks. 

Currently, this add-on allows the user to adjust the following parameters: 

Print-ready scaling,length,angle, number of divisions, reduction in branching distance, inlet/outlet, bounding box, skin radius, and Murray’s Law implementation. 

###Documentation 

This git repository includes: The python file for the add-on. 

###Installation/Usage Instructions

1) Download the .py file
2) In Blender, navigate to User Preferences > Add-ons > Install from File > Downloaded .py file
3) Ensure it is checked in the add-on menu - It will be called “Add Mesh: Intussusception”
4) To use type spacebar in the Blender Window and search for “Intussusception”
